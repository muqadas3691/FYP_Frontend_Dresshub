  <p>Lenders must ensure all items are clean, damage-free, and accurately described before listing.</p>
  <p>Only genuine and legally owned clothing can be listed. Counterfeit items are strictly prohibited.</p>
  <p>
    Lenders set rental prices and durations, but rates should reflect the item's condition and market
    value.
  </p>
  <p>Lenders may charge a reasonable fee for significant damage or loss beyond normal wear and tear.</p>
  <p>Lenders must allow cancellations up to 24 hours before the rental period begins.</p>
  <p>Items must be returned by renters in the condition received. Late returns may incur additional fees.</p>
  <p>Items must be cleaned or sanitized between rentals to ensure quality and hygiene.</p>
  <p>DressHub will take a percentage of each successful rental transaction as a service fee.</p>
  <p>In case of disputes, DressHub will mediate based on submitted evidence from both parties.</p>
  <p>DressHub is not responsible for loss or damages but will facilitate fair resolutions between users.</p>
  <p>
    If a lender receives 3 verified complaints from renters (regarding item condition, late delivery, or
    misrepresentation), their account may be suspended or permanently removed by DressHub admin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lenders with consistent positive reviews and zero complaints over six months receive reduced platform
    fees or promotional boosts for their listings.
  </p>
  <p>
    If renters fail to return items on time, lenders are eligible for late return fees or extended rental
    payments until the item is returned.
